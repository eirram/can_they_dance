# can_they_dance
An attempt to use nested dictionaries using names from the popular British TV show 'Strictly Come Dancing'

# This project is an attempt to model participants of the popular British
# dance show 'Strictly Come Dancing'. User should be able to enter the name
# a celebrity, or anybody else for that matter, and the program should return
# results saying whether this person participated or not. If the name of a
# participant is true, then the programs presents a number of facts around
# that celebrity dancer.

# First we tackle the most recent year to work out the kinks and bugs.
# As the professionals cover multiple series, keys and values may be
# different.


# Epilogue;
# This was my first attempt to complete an idea into working code.
# 
# This format of dictionary and lookup seems to work well. There is of
# course not much in the sense of complexity.

# Should I come up with more ideas around this project, the github
# repository will be updated. For now I consider this project to be
# finished as far as the educational aspect goes.
